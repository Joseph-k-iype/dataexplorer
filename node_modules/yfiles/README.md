# yFiles for HTML Downloader Dummy Module

This module helps you download [yFiles for HTML](https://yworks.com/yfileshtml?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=redirect). 
It does __not__ contain the diagramming software library or anything that would be necessary to work with
_yFiles for HTML_. You probably don't need this module. It exists to prevent users of the yFiles for HTML package from
accidentally or purposefully publishing yFiles for HTML publicly on NPM. The yFiles software does come as an NPM module and may
be published in private npm repositories, but it may not be published publicly without prior written consent of yWorks GmbH.

## I accidentally loaded/installed/ran this

Don't worry, just uninstall it again. 
Still, if you do an `npx yfiles` or `npm i -g yfiles` or even an `npm i yfiles` this tool
will kindly open the yFiles website for you and will offer to download and install the [yFiles Dev Suite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yfiles-dev-suite) npm tool for you, instead. So it wasn't totally in vain, after all! ;-)

But then again, you could just as well do:

```
 > npm i -g yfiles-dev-suite
 > yfiles-dev-suite
```

Or just visit the [yFiles for HTML](https://yworks.com/yfileshtml?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=redirect)
website and continue from there.

# Scaffolding yFiles for HTML applications

There are different scaffolding options to get started with yFiles prototyping in no time. Whether you want to create a Typescript or Ecmascript6/7 application 
or whether you want AMD loading, webpack, browserify, system.js or simple script loading, there is a way to scaffold a basic application or to directly start with 
one of the [100+ source code demos](https://live.yworks.com/demos/).

## yFiles Dev Suite 

The [yFiles Dev Suite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yfiles-dev-suite) is a graphical interface that facilitates working with a [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html) software package:

* Integration with [my.yworks.com](https://my.yworks.com/) for a simplified evaluation process and direct communication with the yWorks support team.
* Create your own yFiles app with just a few clicks.
* Browse and adapt the plethora of [demo applications](https://live.yworks.com/demos/), manage your changes through integrated diffing, and spawn your own projects from one of the samples as a starting point.

See how it works, in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzRAB-oP_uw) on YouTube.

## App Generator

The [App Generator](https://www.yworks.com/products/app-generator) is a tool that lets you interactively create a diagram application prototype to visualize your data with very little programming knowledge. 
It generates and exports the source code of configurable prototype applications with different frameworks (e.g. React, Vue.js or Angular) with features like editing, context menu, graph search, printing and graph editing capabilities.

## Yeoman with `generator-yfiles-app`

The [generator-yfiles-app](https://github.com/yWorks/generator-yfiles-app) is a generator for [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) with which you can scaffold yFiles base applications with different features. 
A CLI guides you through different options (e.g. loading methods or tooling and frameworks) to create a basic sample application eventually.

# License

__Happy diagramming!__
